IN THE 1940S, THE FIRST RECOGNIZABLY LANGUAGE REQUIRED A GREAT
DEAL OF INTELLECTUAL EFFORT. AN EARLY PROPOSAL FOR A HIGH-LEVEL
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WAS PLANKALKUL, DEVELOPED BY KONRAD ZUSE FOR
HIS Z1 COMPUTER BETWEEN 1943 AND 1945 BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME.
THE FIRST FUNCTIONING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES DESIGNED TO
COMMUNICATE INSTRUCTIONS TO A COMPUTER WERE WRITTEN IN THE EARLY
1950S. JOHN MAUCHLY\'S SHORT CODE, PROPOSED IN 1949, WAS ONE OF THE
FIRST HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES EVER DEVELOPED FOR AN ELECTRONIC
COMPUTER. UNLIKE MACHINE CODE, SHORT CODE STATEMENTS REPRESENTED
MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS IN UNDERSTANDABLE FORM. HOWEVER, THE
PROGRAM HAD TO BE TRANSLATED INTO MACHINE CODE EVERY TIME IT RAN,
MAKING THE PROCESS MUCH SLOWER THAN RUNNING THE EQUIVALENT
MACHINE CODE. IN THE EARLY 1950S, ALICK GLENNIE DEVELOPED AUTOCODE,
POSSIBLY THE FIRST COMPILED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER. IN 1954, A SECOND ITERATION OF THE
LANGUAGE, KNOWN AS THE "MARK 1 AUTOCODE," WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE MARK 1
BY R. A. BROOKER. BROOKER ALSO DEVELOPED AN AUTOCODE FOR THE FERRANTI
MERCURY IN THE 1950S IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF
MANCHESTER. THE VERSION FOR THE EDSAC 2 WAS DEVISED BY DOUGLAS
HARTREE OF UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE MATHEMATICAL LABORATORY IN
1961. KNOWN AS EDSAC 2 AUTOCODE, IT WAS A STRAIGHT DEVELOPMENT FROM
MERCURY AUTOCODE ADAPTED FOR LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WAS
NOTED FOR ITS OBJECT CODE OPTIMIZATION AND SOURCE-LANGUAGE
DIAGNOSTICS WHICH WERE ADVANCED FOR THE TIME. A CONTEMPORARY BUT
SEPARATE THREAD OF DEVELOPMENT, ATLAS AUTOCODE WAS DEVELOPED FOR
THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER ATLAS 1 MACHINE. IN 1954, FORTRAN WAS
INVENTED AT IBM BY A TEAM LED BY JOHN BACKUS; IT WAS THE FIRST WIDELY
USED HIGH-LEVEL GENERAL PURPOSE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO HAVE A
FUNCTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION, AS OPPOSED TO JUST A DESIGN ON PAPER.
WHEN FORTRAN WAS FIRST INTRODUCED, IT WAS VIEWED WITH SKEPTICISM
DUE TO BUGS, DELAYS IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COMPARATIVE EFFICIENCY
OF "HAND-CODED" PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY. HOWEVER, IN A
HARDWARE MARKET THAT WAS RAPIDLY EVOLVING; THE LANGUAGE
EVENTUALLY BECAME KNOWN FOR ITS EFFICIENCY. IT IS STILL A POPULAR
LANGUAGE FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND IS USED FOR
PROGRAMS THAT BENCHMARK AND RANK THE WORLD\'S FASTEST
SUPERCOMPUTERS.
